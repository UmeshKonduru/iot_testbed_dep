Welcome to the **IoT Testbed** documentation! This guide will help new users and developers quickly understand the purpose of the testbed, its major components, and how to get everything up and running on their machines.

## What is the IoT Testbed?

The IoT Testbed provides a scalable framework for deploying code ("jobs") to remote devices (dongles) via gateway Raspberry Pis, all managed from a central server. It supports:

* **Secure device registration** and status tracking
* **Bulk job submission** and monitoring via Job Groups
* **Heartbeat** and health monitoring of gateways and devices

Whether you’re a researcher running experiments or a developer integrating new hardware, this testbed streamlines device management and job execution.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have:

* **Git** installed (to clone the repository)
* **Docker** installed (to setup the containers) 
* One or more **Raspberry Pi** gateways with the gateway client code
* Programmable **NRF Dongles**

## Quick Start Example

Follow these steps to see the testbed in action:

1. **Clone the repo**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/UmeshKonduru/iot_testbed_dep.git
   cd iot_testbed_dep
   ```

2. **Get the containers running**

   ```bash
   docker compose up -d --build
   ```

3. **Configure gateway**

   On each Raspberry Pi, clone the gateway client:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/UmeshKonduru/gateway_client.git
   cd gateway_client
   activate_env
   python gateway_client.py
   ```

4. **Register a gateway**

   In the server UI, request a new gateway registration token and run:

   ```bash
   python gateway_registration.py
   ```

5. **Add a device**

   ```bash
   python gateway_add_device.py
   ```
